### Unit 3: Environmental Foundations: India's Challenges and Solutions

**I. Main Natural Resources and Their Significance**

Natural resources are materials and supplies drawn from the Earth that are useful to humans, including food, building materials, water, and energy. They are developed without human intervention and are categorized based on their availability:

*   **Renewable Resources**: These are consistently available or can be replenished after utilization. Examples include **vegetation, water, and air**. Animals can also be considered renewable as they reproduce. Renewable resources can be organic (from living things like plants and animals) or inorganic (from non-living things like sun, water, and wind). They are sustainable, generally low cost, and environment-friendly, replenishing quickly.
*   **Non-Renewable Resources**: These are finite and cannot be easily substituted or recovered once used. Examples include **fossil fuels (petrol, coal)** and **minerals**. Minerals are non-renewable because their formation takes thousands of years. Endangered species are also regarded as non-renewable due to their proximity to extinction. These resources are exhaustible, higher cost, and replenish slowly or not at all. Non-renewable resources can be recyclable (e.g., metals) or non-recyclable (e.g., fossil fuels).

**A. Land Resources**
Landforms such as hills, valleys, plains, and river basins are resource-generating areas. If utilized carefully, land can be a renewable resource, as roots of trees and grasses bind the soil.
*   **Land Degradation**: This is the deterioration of soil or loss of fertility, often due to over-exploitation caused by increasing population, urbanization, and excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Effects include destruction of soil texture, loss of fertility and nutrients, increased waterlogging, salinity, alkalinity, and loss of biodiversity.
*   **Soil Erosion**: This is the loss or removal of the topsoil layer by wind, water, or human factors. Causes include rain, rapid water flow, wind, overgrazing (35%), and deforestation (30%). Construction activities also contribute. Control measures involve slowing water movement, encouraging water infiltration, increasing soil particle size, reducing wind velocity, and practices like conservational tillage, organic farming, crop rotation, contour ploughing, mulching, strip cropping, terrace farming, agroforestry, and windbreaks.
*   **Desertification**: This process reduces the productive potential of arid or semi-arid lands, characterized by de-vegetation, groundwater depletion, salinization, and severe soil erosion. Causes include deforestation, overgrazing, over-utilization of water, mining, quarrying, and climate change.

**B. Forest Resources**
Forests are vital renewable resources that cover about 30% of the world's area. India's forest cover was 20.6% of its geographical area as of 2005.
*   **Significance**: Forests provide **commercial products** like wood and timber, **food, medicine, and livelihoods for tribal communities**, act as **habitat for wildlife**, reduce global warming, absorb toxic gases, help in soil conservation, regulate the hydrological cycle, and offer **aesthetic value**.
*   **Over-exploitation and Deforestation**: Driven by increasing population, demand for fuelwood, urban expansion, and industrial needs, deforestation is rampant, especially in developing countries.
    *   **Causes**: **Shifting cultivation (jhum cultivation)**, commercial logging, demand for fuelwood, expansion for agribusiness, development projects, and raw materials for industries.
    *   **Effects**: Soil erosion, loss of soil fertility, decreased rainfall, desert expansion, climate change, water table depletion, loss of biodiversity, and environmental disturbances.
    *   **Threats**: Unsustainable timber felling, illegal wood extraction, forest fragmentation, and habitat loss lead to species extinction.
    *   **Conservation**: Requires cautious resource use, alternative energy sources, afforestation, and protection through National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries.

**C. Water Resources**
Water is indispensable for life, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface, but less than 1% is fresh water available for human consumption.
*   **Uses**: **Agriculture (69% in India)**, industry (raw material, coolant, solvent, energy source), domestic use (drinking, cleaning, cooking), hydropower generation (16% globally), navigation, and recreation.
*   **Over-exploitation and Water Scarcity**: Continuous overutilization of surface and groundwater, coupled with pollution, has led to water scarcity. Nearly **three billion people worldwide suffer from water scarcity**.
    *   **Impact of Climate Change**: Rising global temperatures increase evaporation and transpiration, affecting precipitation patterns and water availability.
    *   **Floods and Droughts**: Extreme rainfall leads to floods, causing damage to crops, property, and life, while prolonged lack of rain causes droughts, leading to food and fodder scarcity.

**II. Water Crisis Problems and River Water Conflicts**

Water scarcity is a global issue, often leading to national (inter-state) and international disputes over shared water resources.
*   **Cauvery River Water Conflict**: This is a major inter-state water sharing dispute involving **Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Puducherry**.
    *   **Historical Context**: The conflict dates back to the **19th century**. Historically, Tamil Nadu used about 602 TMC of the river's yield, leaving 138 TMC for Karnataka.
    *   **1924 Agreement**: Tamil Nadu built the Mettur Dam. An agreement was signed, effective for 50 years, allowing Tamil Nadu to expand agriculture by 1.1 million acres and Karnataka to expand irrigation from 300,000 to 1 million acres.
    *   **1974 Lapse**: The accord lapsed, and Karnataka claimed it restricted its development, beginning to build reservoirs, leading to the dispute.
    *   **2018 Supreme Court Ruling**: On **February 16, 2018**, the Supreme Court delivered its verdict, allocating the total of 740 TMC water as follows:
        *   Tamil Nadu: **404.25 TMC**
        *   Karnataka: **284.75 TMC**
        *   Kerala: **30 TMC**
        *   Puducherry: **7 TMC**
        *   Environmental Protection: **10 TMC**
        *   Inevitable wastage into sea: **4 TMC**
    *   **Management Bodies**: The **Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA)** and **Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC)** were established in **2018** to implement the verdict.
    *   **Recent Developments (2023)**: In August 2023, Tamil Nadu requested 24,000 cusecs of water due to drought, but Karnataka refused, citing its own shortage. In September 2023, CWMA directed Karnataka to release 5,000 cusecs for 15 days, which Karnataka complied with reluctantly, later appealing a directive to provide 3,000 cusecs.

**III. Impacts of Dams and Mining on the Environment and Human Health**

**A. Impacts of Dams**
While dams offer benefits like hydroelectricity and water supply, they are also responsible for significant environmental degradation.
*   **Environmental Degradation**:
    *   **Loss of flora and fauna** and **habitat loss**.
    *   **Large-scale devastation of forests** and changes to forest ecosystems, breaking the natural ecological balance.
    *   Increased incidence of **water-borne diseases**.
    *   Changes in fisheries and spawning grounds.
    *   Siltation and sedimentation of reservoirs.
    *   Growth of aquatic weeds and microclimatic changes.
    *   Increased prevalence of **floods and droughts** in affected areas.
*   **Human Impact**:
    *   **Displacement of tribal communities** and other local populations.
    *   Loss of productive land due to submergence.
    *   **Case Study: Sardar Sarovar Dam**: Environmental activists like **Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy, and Baba Amte** have taken up causes related to this dam due to its significant ecological and social impacts.

**B. Impacts of Mining**
Mining operations have severe environmental and human health consequences.
*   **Environmental Degradation**:
    *   **Degradation of lands and loss of topsoil** from surface mining.
    *   Destroys topography and landscapes.
    *   **Large-scale deforestation**, leading to unstable zones and landslides.
    *   **Pollution of water sources** and drying up of perennial water sources like springs and streams.
*   **Examples of Impact**:
    *   Illegal mining in **Sariska Tiger Reserve** (Rajasthan) led to significant forest destruction and water pollution.
    *   Extensive deforestation in **Jharkhand** due to coal mining in Jharia, Raniganj, and Singrauli areas.
    *   Forest destruction in **Mussorie and Dehradun valley** due to mining.
    *   Mining of radioactive minerals in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka poses threats of deforestation.
    *   Rich forests of the **Western Ghats** face threats from mining for copper, chromites, bauxite, and magnetite.

**IV. Types of Energy Sources**

Energy resources are crucial for economic development and are broadly classified into renewable and non-renewable sources.
*   **Renewable Energy Sources**: These can be replenished naturally. India's energy policy aims for a graduated shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources, with **solar energy** at center-stage.
    *   **Hydel Energy**: India has a potential of about 1.5 lakh MW, with small hydro plants accounting for 15,000 MW, primarily in northern and eastern hilly regions.
    *   **Wind Energy**: India has a potential of about 45,000 MW, with states like Gujarat, AP, Karnataka, MP, and Rajasthan having over 5,000 MW potential each.
    *   **Geothermal Energy**: Generated and stored in the Earth, it is cost-effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly.
    *   **Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)**: Uses temperature differences between cool deep and warm shallow ocean waters to produce electricity, especially viable in tropical areas.
    *   **Biomass Energy**: Organic waste (dead plant/animal material, dung, kitchen waste) converted into biogas (65% methane, 35% CO2), used for cooking or electricity. India has 3500 MW potential from bagasse.
    *   **Bio-fuels**: Jatropha can be cultivated on wasteland to produce biofuels.
    *   **Solar Energy**: India, as a tropical country, has vast potential (4-7 kWh per sq. m per day). It is environmentally friendly with zero emissions and offers energy security due to its abundant availability. It allows for decentralized power generation and rapid capacity addition.
        *   **Advantages**: Abundant, clean, decentralized.
        *   **Disadvantages**: High initial cost, space-intensive, variability (especially during monsoons), requires effective storage.
*   **Non-Renewable Energy Sources**: These are available in limited amounts and cannot be replenished.
    *   Examples: **Coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear energy (e.g., uranium)**.
    *   **Disadvantages**: Contribute to **global warming, acid rain**, oil spills, and air/water pollution.

*   **Main Reason Behind (Perspectives)**:
    *   **Corporate Negligence**: Asserted that the disaster resulted from **poorly maintained facilities, lax safety practices, and an inadequately trained workforce**, allowing water to inadvertently enter MIC tanks.
    *   **Worker Sabotage**: Advocated by Union Carbide, suggesting a rogue employee deliberately connected a water hose to an empty tank valve, an action concealed by the Indian government.
*   **Famous Personalities/Key Players**:
    *   **Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL)**: The plant where the disaster occurred.
    *   **Union Carbide Corporation (UCC)**: The parent company.
    *   **Warren Anderson**: UCC's chairman, placed under house arrest upon arrival in India.
*   **Toxic Gas**: **Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)**, a highly toxic gas. Stored in three underground tanks, with regulations stipulating no more than 50% fill.
*   **Earlier Leaks**: Prior to 1984, there were several leaks: in **1976**, trade unions raised concerns; in **1981**, a worker died from phosgene gas exposure; in **January 1982**, 24 workers were exposed to phosgene; in **February 1982**, 18 workers were affected by an MIC leak; and in **August 1982**, a chemical engineer suffered burns from liquid MIC. Subsequent leaks occurred in 1982, 1983, and 1984, involving MIC, chlorine, monomethylamine, phosgene, and carbon tetrachloride.
*   **Impact/Outcomes**:
    *   **Victims**: Over **500,000 people exposed**. By the morning after, thousands had perished. Compensation paid to families of **3,787 killed** and **574,366 injured** by 2008. Estimates suggest **8,000 died within two weeks**, and **another 8,000 or more have since died** from gas-related diseases.
    *   **Acute Effects**: Coughing, severe eye irritation, suffocation, respiratory burning, blepharospasm, breathlessness, stomach pains, vomiting. Autopsies revealed lung changes, cerebral edema, kidney necrosis, liver degeneration, and intestinal necrosis.
    *   **Long-term Consequences (Survivors)**: Cancer, blindness, loss of livelihood.
    *   **Immediate Aftermath**: Indian government closed the plant to outsiders, including UCC, and failed to release data. UCC organized a team of international medical experts, but the local healthcare system struggled. Mass funerals, animal carcass disposal, and food scarcity ensued.
    *   **Environmental Rehabilitation/Ongoing Contamination**: After closure in **1986**, the plant area became a **dumping ground for hazardous chemicals**. Tests in **1989** by UCC revealed toxic soil and water. Pollutants identified include 1-naphthol, naphthalene, Sevin, mercury, organochlorines, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and hexachloroethane. High levels of **carbon tetrachloride (carcinogenic toxin)** found in drinking water. Contamination persisted, affecting soil, groundwater, well water, vegetables, and breast milk of nearby women. A British photojournalist was hospitalized in **2010** due to toxic dust. In **2011**, scientists called for renewed international cleanup efforts.
