### Unit 1: Key Concepts in Environmental Studies

#### Environmental Components

The "Environment" encompasses everything around us, including both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) elements. The term "Environment" is derived from the French word 'Environ', meaning 'surrounding'.

The **Environmental Protection Act of 1986** defines environment as including **"water, air and land and the inter-relationship which exists among and between water, air and land, and human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro-organism and property"**. Interactions between these biotic and abiotic components form a functional ecosystem and support life on Earth.

The four main components of the Earth's environment are:

- **Atmosphere**: This is the protective cover of gases surrounding the Earth, crucial for sustaining life and shielding it from harsh external conditions. It regulates climate, weather patterns, and the air we breathe.
- **Hydrosphere**: This includes all forms of water on Earth, such as oceans, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and glaciers. It is essential for life, aquatic habitats, and processes like the water cycle and nutrient distribution.
- **Lithosphere**: This refers to the solid outer layer of the Earth, consisting of the crust and uppermost mantle. It provides habitats, contains valuable mineral resources, and interacts with the atmosphere and hydrosphere.
- **Biosphere**: This encompasses all living organisms and their interactions with the environment, relying on the other components for sustenance. It includes plants, animals, microorganisms, and ecosystems, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling, energy flow, and maintaining ecological balance.

#### Atmospheric Layers

The Earth's atmosphere is divided into several distinct layers based on temperature changes with increasing altitude:

- **Troposphere**:
    - **Definition**: The lowest layer of the atmosphere.
    - **Depth**: Extends from the Earth's surface up to an average altitude of about 8-15 kilometers (5-9 miles).
    - **Significance**: This is where most weather phenomena occur, including cloud formation and precipitation. It contains 70% of gaseous components. Temperature generally decreases with increasing altitude in this layer.
    - **Prominent Chemical Species**: N2, O2, Ar, CO2, H2O.
- **Stratosphere**:
    - **Definition**: Lies above the troposphere.
    - **Depth**: Extends from about 11 km to 50 km.
    - **Significance**: Contains the **ozone layer**, which absorbs and scatters much of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation, protecting life on Earth. Temperature generally increases with altitude due to this absorption.
    - **Prominent Chemical Species**: O3 (Ozone).
- **Mesosphere**:
    - **Definition**: Beyond the stratosphere.
    - **Depth**: Extends from about 50 km to 85 km.
    - **Significance**: Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, reaching extremely low temperatures. It is where meteors burn up upon entering the Earth's atmosphere.
    - **Prominent Chemical Species**: O2+, NO+.
- **Thermosphere**:
    - **Definition**: Above the mesosphere.
    - **Depth**: Extends from about 85 km to 600 km.
    - **Significance**: Temperature increases dramatically with altitude due to the absorption of high-energy solar radiation. However, due to its sparse nature, objects within it would feel extremely cold.
    - **Prominent Chemical Species**: O2+, O+, NO+.
- **Exosphere**:
    - **Definition**: The outermost layer, blending into the vacuum of space.
    - **Significance**: Characterized by extremely low densities and the presence of atoms and molecules escaping from Earth's gravitational pull.

#### Brief History of Environmentalism

The environmental movement gained significant traction in the Western world after key publications and events:

- **1962**: Publication of **Rachael Carson's "Silent Spring"**, which raised concerns about the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the U.S. and their environmental impact.
- **1970**: **"Limit to Growth" by the Club of Rome** attracted global attention to environmental issues.
- **February 2, 1971**: **Ramsar Convention** came into existence, aiming to conserve wetlands globally. This date is observed as World Wetlands Day.

- **December 2-3, 1984**: The **Bhopal Gas Tragedy**, considered the world's worst industrial disaster, occurred at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) plant in Bhopal, India, exposing over 500,000 people to highly toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas.
- **April 26, 1986**: The **Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster** occurred, further highlighting industrial safety concerns.
- **1985**: **Vienna Convention** was signed to protect the ozone layer.
- **September 16, 1987**: The **Montreal Protocol** was signed, proposing redesigning refrigeration and air conditioning technology to replace ozone-depleting CFCs with ozone-friendly substitutes. This date is often associated with World Ozone Day.
- **1987**: The concept of **Sustainable Development** was introduced globally through the **Brundtland Commission Report ("Our Common Future")**.
- **1989**: The **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** was established to formulate frameworks to combat global warming and climate change.
- **1992**: The **Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro** adopted **Agenda 21** and saw the signing of the UN trio sister conventions: **UNFCCC, UNCBD, and UNCCD**.
- **1997**: The **Kyoto Protocol** was signed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
- **2002**: The **World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio + 10)** was conducted in Johannesburg.
- **November 30, 2015**: The Government of India initiated the **International Solar Alliance**, headquartered in Gurugram, India, to motivate tropical and sub-tropical countries to maximize solar energy use.

#### Sustainable Development

The concept of sustainable development revolves around the idea of **meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs**. It recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic systems, aiming for a balance that ensures long-term well-being for both people and the planet.

Its history can be traced back to the **Brundtland Commission Report (Our Common Future)** in 1987, which brought the concept to global prominence.

Sustainable development is often illustrated by three main **pillars**:

- **Environmental Sustainability**: Focuses on preserving and restoring ecosystem health, conserving biodiversity, minimizing pollution and resource depletion, mitigating climate change, and promoting renewable energy sources.
- **Social Sustainability**: Addresses the well-being of individuals and communities, ensuring social equity, justice, inclusivity, human rights, and access to education, healthcare, and basic services.
- **Economic Sustainability**: Emphasizes efficient and resilient economic systems that promote long-term prosperity, responsible resource management, sustainable production and consumption, and the integration of environmental costs and benefits into economic decision-making.

These three pillars intersect to create a **"bearable, equitable and viable globe,"** which collectively forms a sustainable world.

The **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** are a collection of **17 global goals** set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 for the year 2030, covering social, economic, and environmental aspects. The sources mention the total number of SDGs (17) but do not list their individual names.

#### Multidisciplinary Nature of Environmental Studies (EVS)

Environmental Studies is a **multidisciplinary field** that draws knowledge and methods from various disciplines to understand and address complex environmental issues. It recognizes that environmental challenges require integrated approaches considering ecological, social, economic, and political factors.

Key disciplines contributing to EVS include:

- **Ecology and Environmental Science**: Provides the foundation for understanding ecological principles, biodiversity, ecosystems, and human impacts.
- **Environmental Policy and Law**: Examines regulations, policies, and legal frameworks for environmental protection and resource management at various levels.
- **Environmental Economics**: Explores the economic aspects, such as resource valuation, cost-benefit analysis, and economic incentives for sustainable practices.
- **Environmental Sociology**: Investigates social, cultural, and political factors influencing human-environment relationships, attitudes, decision-making, and environmental movements.
- **Geology and Geosciences**: Contributes to understanding geological processes, natural hazards, and interactions between Earth's physical systems and the environment.
- **Environmental Engineering**: Focuses on developing technologies and strategies for pollution control, waste management, and sustainable infrastructure design.
- **Anthropology and Human Geography**: Offers insights into cultural, social, and historical aspects of human interactions with the environment, including resource perception and use.

This multidisciplinary approach ensures comprehensive solutions that integrate scientific, social, economic, and policy perspectives.

#### Significance of EVS as a Subject

Environmental Studies has emerged as a crucial multidisciplinary subject over the last five decades, dealing with all aspects of environmental issues and challenges, and proposing practical solutions. Its significance stems from its vast scope and the diverse professional opportunities it offers.
